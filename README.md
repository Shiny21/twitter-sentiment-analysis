**What is Sentiment Analysis?**
    
    Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral.
    Itâ€™s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 
    A common use case for this technology is to discover how people feel about a particular topic.
     
    
**Phase 1 - Train the classifier**
    
    In this phase we are going to learn how to train a sentiment classifier. 
    For the classification, either you have to use any already existing trained data set or you can create a new one.
    Here we are just creating a new one with 3 child directories for positive, negative, neutral results.
    
**Phase 2 - Load the classifier**

    By using the trained classifier we can do the sentiment classification in phase 2.
    
**Phase 3 - Download and classify the tweets**
